# Loose-Coupled

Loose coupling is a design principle in software engineering where the components of a system are designed to have minimal interdependence on each other. In a loosely coupled system, the components are able to operate independently without knowing the details of how the other components work.

The main advantages of loose coupling are:

          1 - Flexibility: A loosely coupled system is more flexible because it allows components to be easily added, removed or modified without affecting the rest of   the system.
          2 - Testability: Components in a loosely coupled system can be tested independently, making it easier to isolate and fix errors.
          3 - Scalability: Loose coupling allows a system to scale more easily by adding more components or by distributing components across different servers.
          4 - Reusability: Components in a loosely coupled system can be reused in different contexts, which reduces development time and costs.

In contrast, tight coupling is a design principle where the components of a system are highly interdependent and have a strong reliance on each other. Tight coupling can make a system more difficult to maintain, modify, and test.
